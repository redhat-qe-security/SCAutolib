"""
This module provides methods allowing to configure the system for smart-card
authentication using the ``authselect`` tool.

It is implemented as a context manager (``Authselect`` class), which
ensures that system configurations are properly set up upon entry and
restored to their original state upon exit.
The module interacts with ``authselect(8)`` to apply the ``sssd`` profile
with specified features (for more information see manual page for
``authselect(8)``).
