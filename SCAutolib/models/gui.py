"""
This module provides a comprehensive set of tools for automating graphical user
interface (GUI) interactions and assertions within the SCAutolib framework.
It defines classes for capturing screenshots
(``Screen``), controlling mouse movements and clicks (``Mouse``), and managing
keyboard input (through ``keyboard`` python module).
The central ``GUI`` class orchestrates these interactions, allowing for the
creation of automated GUI test sequences with logging and visual verification
capabilities.
